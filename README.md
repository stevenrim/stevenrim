<h1>Aspiring Infosec Professional</h1>

Greetings, cyber adventurers! 

Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio as I chronicle my journey into InfoSec. Here, you'll find my ethical hands-on projects from school, online courses, and YouTube tutorials made by amazing people in this industry. This journey isn't just about meâ€”it's also about inspiring you. Whether you're an enthusiast, a budding cyberwarrior, or a future employer, know that every keystroke, every byte, and every analysis tells a story. Mine is just beginning and I hope what I share here adds a spark to your own adventure. -Steven aka 9purp0s3
