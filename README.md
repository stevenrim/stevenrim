<h1>Aspiring Infosec Professional</h1>

Greetings, cyber adventurers! 

Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio as I chronicle my journey into InfoSec. Here, you'll find my ethical hands-on projects from school, online courses, and YouTube tutorials made by amazing people in this industry. This journey isn't just about meâ€”it's also about inspiring you. Whether you're an enthusiast, a budding cyberwarrior, or a future employer, know that every keystroke, every byte, and every analysis tells a story. Mine is just beginning and I hope what I share here adds a spark to your own adventure. -Steven aka 9purp0s3

Yours truly,

<h2>Cybersecurity Projects</h2>

- <b>[SOC + Honeynet w/Azure (Live Traffic)]()</b>
    - Constructed a honeynet on Azure to ingest logs from resources into a Log Analytics workspace. Used Kusto Query Language to query logs. Utilized Microsoft Sentinel to build attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents. Measured the insecure environment, applied security controls, measured the secure environment, and analyzed results. 
- <b>[Active Directory Home Lab w/VirtualBox]()</b>
    - Created and configured two virtual machines on Oracle VirtualBox; Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10. Ran Active Directory on Server 2019. Added 1000 users in Active Directory with PowerShell script. Successfully used client to access the internet through the private network. 
- <b>[Vulnerability Management Lab w/Nessus]()</b>
    - Installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans. Created a vulnerable Windows 10 VM on VirtualBox with outdated software and disabled Firewall. Performed unauthenticated and credentialed scans using Nessus against vulnerable Windows 10 VM with outdated software. Analyzed results, identified vulnerabilities, remediated vulnerabilities, and verified successful remediation through subsequent scans.
- <b>[Identifying and Exploiting Web Application Vulnerabilities w/OWASP Juice Shop]()</b>
    - (coming soon)
- <b>[Building a Raspberry Pi CM4 Compute Blade Server]()</b>
    - (coming soon)
- <b>[Projects from HackTheBox SOC Pathway]()</b>
    - (coming soon)
- <b>[Ducky Scripts]()</b>
    - (coming soon)
