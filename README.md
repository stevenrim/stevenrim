<h1>Aspiring Infosec Professional</h1>

Greetings, cyber adventurers! 

Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio as I chronicle my journey into InfoSec. Here, you'll find my ethical hands-on projects from school, online courses, and YouTube tutorials made by amazing people in this industry. This journey isn't just about me—it's also about inspiring you. Whether you're an enthusiast, a budding cyberwarrior, or a future employer, know that every keystroke, every byte, and every analysis tells a story.

Used Kusto Query Language to query logs. Utilized Microsoft Sentinel to build attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents. Measured the insecure environment, applied security controls, measured the secure environment, and analyzed results. |
| ![Active Directory Home Lab w/VirtualBox](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*snXduusSKqhuinZbGgaC2w.jpeg) |<b>[Active Directory Home Lab w/VirtualBox](https://medium.com/@stevenrim/active-directory-home-lab-w-virtualbox-e07932251a9f)</b> - For this project, my main goal was to create 1000 users on Active Directory, log in on the client machine, and access the Internet via a private network. I successfully downloaded, installed, and configured two virtual machines and created the users using an automated PowerShell script. I then I successfully logged on as a user and was able to access the internet. Here are the steps I took to complete my project. |
| ![SOC Pathway and CDSA Certification w/HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/storage/blog/ceWOP6W5gJqYVSDRjS1h88NRVOu7KKJb.jpg) |<b>[SOC Pathway and CDSA Certification w/HackTheBox](https://medium.com/@stevenrim/hackthebox-certified-defensive-security-analyst-cdsa-journey-5bb5fbeaa1d7)</b> - I’m starting this project to share some of the labs I’ll complete throughout my HTB CDSA and SOC Analyst pathway journey. The HTB CDSA certification evaluates hands-on skills in security analysis, SOC operations, and incident handling. Upon completion, I’ll be better equipped to detect security incidents, identify detection methods, and create actionable incident reports. This particular project will continually be updated until I complete each section and obtain my HTB CDSA certification. |
