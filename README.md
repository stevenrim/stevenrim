<h1>Aspiring Infosec Professional</h1>

Greetings, cyber adventurers! 

Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio as I chronicle my journey into InfoSec. Here, you'll find my hands-on labs from online platforms like HTB and THM, and ethical projects inspired by amazing security YouTubers. This journey isn't just about me, it's also about inspiring you. Whether you're an enthusiast, a budding cyberwarrior, or a future employer, know that every keystroke, every byte, and every analysis tells a story. Mine is just beginning and I hope what I share here adds a spark to your own adventure.

Yours truly,

Steven aka 9purp0s3

<h2>Defensive Projects</h2>

- <b>[Cloud Honeynet + SOC in Azure](https://medium.com/@stevenrim/building-a-cloud-honeynet-soc-in-azure-980f84fb5147)</b>
  - Constructed a honeynet on Azure to ingest logs from resources into a Log Analytics workspace. Used Kusto Query Language to query logs. Utilized Microsoft Sentinel to build attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents. Measured the insecure environment, applied security controls, measured the secure environment, and analyzed results.
- <b>[Active Directory Home Lab w/VirtualBox](https://medium.com/@stevenrim/active-directory-home-lab-w-virtualbox-e07932251a9f)</b>
  - For this project, my main goal was to create 1000 users on Active Directory, log in on the client machine, and access the Internet via a private network. I successfully downloaded, installed, and configured two virtual machines and created the users using an automated PowerShell script. I then I successfully logged on as a user and was able to access the internet. Here are the steps I took to complete my project.
- <b>[SOC Pathway and CDSA Certification w/HackTheBox](https://medium.com/@stevenrim/hackthebox-certified-defensive-security-analyst-cdsa-journey-5bb5fbeaa1d7)</b>
  - I will be sharing the labs I complete throughout my HTB CDSA and SOC Analyst pathway journey. The HTB CDSA certification evaluates hands-on skills in security analysis, SOC operations, and incident handling. Upon completion, I will be better equipped to detect security incidents, identify detection methods, and create actionable incident reports. This particular project will continually be updated until I complete each section and obtain my HTB CDSA certification. Expected to complete in 2024.


<h2>Offensive Projects</h2>

- <b>[Exploiting Web Application Vulnerabilities w/OWASP Juice Shop](https://medium.com/@stevenrim/owasp-juice-shop-10-2-for-arm64-raspberry-pi-5-68c28c046ccd)</b>
  - Used Docker to access OWASP Juice Shop 10.2 for ARM64/Raspberry Pi. Here, I exploit a series of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities with varying levels of difficulty. This particular project will continually be updated until I complete all challenges on this version. So check back often.

I did some research and was inspired by Mad Hat, Sandra Liu, and Gerald Auger,PhD on YouTube. My plan was to use it as a launch pad before tackling the Security+ exam and diving into hands-on labs to build my portfolio. This program definitely provided the foundation I needed to move forward. |
